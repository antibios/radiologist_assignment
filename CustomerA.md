Business Goals for Directing Unread Studies

**WHO CAN SEE WHAT**

- Radiologist only sees what they're rostered to report that day

- Shift definition to match rostered work 'type' (see Robina example)

**Use Case: Robina Site -**

- Covered by on site radiologists
- BUT MRI MSK covered by Dr. Smith elsewhere
- AND Breast work covered by Dr. Jones elsewhere
- When no local radiologist rostered

- Urgents rostered to someone else specifically
- Routine sent to National Overflow

- Radiologists commonly rostered to cover more than one area at a time
- Case responsibility sits with that radiologist until SLA breach (or maybe close to, TBD)

- **Case ownership must follow radiologist onto different shift the next day**
- But at SLA breach, case automatically becomes visible to broader group (see below)

**IF THEY'RE SLOW**

- Study Escalation at SLA breach (or maybe close to, TBD)

- Case visibility to automatically broaden

- Visible distinctly as "breached cases" in MRQ on shifts for that Cluster
- Also visible in a National worklist somewhere (?enterprise ?MRQ, pros and cons?)

**IF THEY'RE AHEAD**

- Can access worklists of Overdue My Cluster & Overdue My SS & some access to National Overdue (?enterprise, ?MRQ)
- **Access to these worklists only visible when their MRQ gets below N cases**

o    Only the next N cases from the candidate pool visible in these worklists

§  Determined according to case Priority then Time Remaining

§  These same cases visible to everyone who's MRQ meets the access threshold

·         Until those cases are done then the appropriate next case released to this worklist

**IF IT'S OUTSIDE ROSTERED SHIFT HOURS**

_Priorities are different as they're working from a place of good-will_

- WHAT THEY SEE

- Everything Unread beyond SLA nationally that they're credentialled for
- NOT limited to N cases or checkpoints to releasing more, simply an open worklist, autonomous and free for all (see autonomy requirements)

 **IF NO ONE COVERS THE SHIFT**

- Work from unmanned shifts to be automatically broadened

- Urgent & Critical: Instantly
- <Routine: +4 hours from Unread
- NOT waiting for SLA escalations to broaden

- **Don't want to need to be notified that a shift hasn't been covered**
- **Don't want to need to manually intervene to move studies from uncovered shifts into overflow**
- **Don't want to need to manually manipulate assignment rules regularly to compensate for absences**

**THE ORDER CASES ARE REPORTED IN**

- User determined sequencing of case reporting

- **Provide IVWL level of autonomy**

- User able to sort and dynamically filter (not save) worklist by any column
- Able to auto-next from any point onwards in this user-defined order
- And for auto-cache to respect and anticipate the order and the commencement point onwards
